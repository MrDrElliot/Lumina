 ** Reflection TODOs **

[ ] - Reflection currently has no way of verifying things that are... reflected. It will essentially accept anything and error out later without much reasoning.
[ ] - Remove the disgusting dependency on visual studio solutions and projects.
[ ] - Fix issue with including macro decls rather then just expansions.
[ ] - Add a pending queue of types that are waiting on other types to be registered so we can query extra information about that type... such as it's namespace.
